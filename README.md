# Kitchen Buddy - Mobile Systems Engineering Project

Kitchen Buddy is a React Native application built with Expo, designed to help users efficiently track their kitchen ingredients. The primary goal is to reduce food waste by providing a clear overview of what's available, what's expiring soon, and what needs to be used.

The application is built following modern mobile development principles, including **Functional Programming** and a strong **TypeScript** foundation. It features a clean, component-based architecture and centralized state management using React's Context API.

## Core Features

-   **Persistent Storage:** All ingredient data is saved on the device using `AsyncStorage`, ensuring it persists between app launches.
-   **Efficient Data Entry:** A streamlined form allows users to add new ingredients, specifying their name, brand, category, location, and expiration date.
-   **Barcode Scanning:** Utilizes the device's camera to scan product barcodes, fetching product data from the OpenFoodFacts API to pre-fill the entry form.
-   **Advanced Ingredient Tracking:**
    -   **Expiration Alerts:** A dedicated screen shows items that are expiring soon or have been opened.
    -   **Ripeness Status:** Users can track and update the ripeness of fresh ingredients (e.g., "Ripe", "Green").
    -   **Open/Frozen Status:** Users can mark items as "open" to prioritize their use or "freeze" them to automatically extend their shelf life.
-   **Smart Querying & Filtering:** A flexible browsing screen allows users to view ingredients by recent additions, missing data, location, category, or ripeness check status.
-   **Full CRUD Functionality:** Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) ingredients.

    
## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on a local development environment.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js (LTS version):** Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **Expo Go App:** Install the "Expo Go" application on your physical iOS or Android device. It is available on the App Store and Google Play Store.
-   **(Optional) Android Studio:** If you want to run the app on an Android emulator, you will need to install Android Studio and set up a virtual device.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Unzip the Project:**
    Unzip the submitted project file (`.zip`) into a folder of your choice.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate into the project's root folder.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/KitchenBuddy
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Run the following command to install all the necessary project dependencies listed in `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, start the Expo development server with the following command. It is recommended to clear the cache on the first run.
    ```bash
    npx expo start -c
    ```

2.  **Connect Your Device:**
    The command will start the Metro bundler and display a QR code in the terminal.

    -   **To run on a physical device (iOS or Android):**
        -   Ensure your phone is connected to the **same Wi-Fi network** as your computer.
        -   Open the "Expo Go" app on your phone and scan the QR code displayed in the terminal.

    -   **To run on an Android Emulator:**
        -   Make sure your Android emulator is running.
        -   Press the `a` key in the terminal where the Expo server is running. Expo will automatically install Expo Go on the emulator and launch the app.

The application should now be running on your device. Any changes saved in the code will trigger a live reload.

## Component Architecture

The application is structured using a component-based architecture. Below is a list of all major custom components defined in the project, along with their responsibilities, props, and internal state.

### 1. Core App Structure & Navigation

-   **`RootLayout` (`app/_layout.tsx`)**
    -   **Description:** The absolute root of the application. It sets up the main `Stack` navigator and, most importantly, wraps the entire app in the `IngredientsProvider` to make the global state available everywhere.
    -   **Props:** None.
    -   **State:** None.

-   **`TabLayout` (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`)**
    -   **Description:** Defines the main bottom tab navigation interface with three primary screens: "Add", "Expiring", and "Browse".
    -   **Props:** None.
    -   **State:** None.

-   **`ScreensLayout` (`app/(screens)/_layout.tsx`)**
    -   **Description:** Defines the stack navigation for auxiliary screens that are pushed on top of the main tabs (like "Edit" and "Scanner"). It configures a consistent header style for these screens.
    -   **Props:** None.
    -   **State:** None.

### 2. Main Screen Components

-   **`AddIngredientScreen` (`app/(tabs)/add.tsx`)**
    -   **Description:** Renders the form for adding new ingredients. It includes input fields, custom pickers, and a date selector. It also features a button to launch the barcode scanner.
    -   **Props:** None.
    -   **State:**
        -   `name: string`: The name of the ingredient.
        -   `brand: string`: The brand of the ingredient.
        -   `category: IngredientCategory`: The selected category.
        -   `location: IngredientLocation`: The selected storage location.

        -   `isDatePickerVisible: boolean`: Controls the visibility of the date picker modal.
        -   `tempDate: Date`: Holds the date value while the iOS date picker is open.

-   **`EditIngredientScreen` (`app/(screens)/edit-ingredient.tsx`)**
    -   **Description:** Almost identical to the Add screen, but it pre-populates its fields with the data of an existing ingredient. It includes additional logic for freezing items and marking them as open.
    -   **Props:** None (receives `ingredientId` via route parameters).
    -   **State:** Same as `AddIngredientScreen`, plus `isOpen: boolean` for the "Open" switch.

-   **`ExpiringScreen` (`app/(tabs)/expiring.tsx`)**
    -   **Description:** Displays a list of ingredients that are expiring soon, have been opened, or are ripe. Provides filter controls (3, 7, 30 days) and a text search bar.
    -   **Props:** None.
    -   **State:**
        -   `daysThreshold: number`: The selected time window for expiring items (3, 7, or 30).
        -   `searchQuery: string`: The text entered into the search bar.

-   **`BrowseScreen` (`app/(tabs)/browse.tsx`)**
    -   **Description:** A flexible screen that displays ingredients based on various queries: recently added, missing data, by location, by category, or ripeness check needed.

    -   **State:**
        -   `permission: CameraPermissionResponse | null`: The camera permission status.
        -   `scanned: boolean`: A flag to prevent multiple scans in quick succession.
        -   `isLoading: boolean`: A flag to show a loading indicator during the API call.

### 3. Reusable Components

-   **`PlatformPicker` (`src/components/PlatformPicker.tsx`)**
    -   **Description:** A hybrid component that renders the native `<Picker>` on Android and a custom, modal-based picker (`CustomPicker`) on iOS to ensure a consistent and functional UX on both platforms.

## Component Tree & Control Flow

This section visualizes the application's component hierarchy. The tree is annotated with comments in `typescript` syntax to illustrate the flow of data, callbacks, and state updates.

**Key for Annotations:**
-   `// Comments:` Explain the purpose and flow at various points.
-   `[STATE]:` Denotes an internal state managed by the component.
-   `{PROP}:` Denotes a prop passed down from a parent.
-   `<fn()>:` Denotes a callback function received from the context.
-   `--[ACTION]-->:` Represents a user interaction that triggers a function.
-   `<--[UPDATE]--:` Represents the re-rendering process triggered by a state change.

```

### Explanation of the Annotated Tree

*   **How callbacks are passed down:**
    The `IngredientsProvider` at the top defines the `addIngredient` and `updateIngredient` callbacks. Any component, such as `AddIngredientScreen` or `EditIngredientScreen`, can access them via the `useIngredients()` hook. The tree shows these components calling the callbacks, which are annotated with `// The handler calls the global callback...`.

*   **How these callbacks change the state:**
    When a callback like `updateIngredient` is invoked, the `// [CALLBACK]` annotation shows that its definition resides in the `IngredientsProvider`. This is where the central `// [STATE]: ingredients[]` is modified immutably. The flow from action to callback execution is clearly visible.

*   **How changes of state change the tree:**
    The annotation `// <--[UPDATE]--> This component automatically re-renders...` on `ExpiringScreen` illustrates the result of a state change. When the `ingredients` state in the `IngredientsProvider` is updated, React re-renders all components that consume it. The `{ingredients}` prop annotation clarifies that these components are receiving the new data, which then updates their UI.
